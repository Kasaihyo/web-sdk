# Esqueleto Explosivo 3 - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
Implementing Esqueleto Explosivo 3, a 5x5 cluster pays slot game with Day of the Dead theme, based on the existing cluster game architecture.

## Completed Work

### 1. Project Setup 
- Copied cluster game as base to `/apps/esqueleto`
- Updated package.json:
  - Name: "esqueleto"
  - Dev port: 3006
  - Storybook port: 6009
- Configured 5x5 grid (vs cluster's 7x7)

### 2. Game Configuration 
- Updated `config.ts` with Esqueleto-specific settings:
  - 5x5 grid dimensions
  - Symbol paytables (LDY, PNK, GRN, BLU, ORG, CYN)
  - Wild spawn settings (100% chance, 50/50 WLD/EW)
  - Explosion settings (3x3 area, targets low-pay symbols)
  - Multiplier progression: 1x ÔøΩ 2x ÔøΩ 4x ÔøΩ 8x ÔøΩ 16x ÔøΩ 32x
  - RTP: 94.22% (base), 94.40% (feature buy)

### 3. Asset Mapping 
Following reusability principle, mapped Esqueleto symbols to existing cluster assets:
- LDY (Lady Skull) ÔøΩ H1 (highest value)
- PNK (Pink Skull) ÔøΩ H2
- GRN (Green Skull) ÔøΩ H3
- BLU (Blue Skull) ÔøΩ H4
- ORG (Orange Skull) ÔøΩ L1
- CYN (Cyan Skull) ÔøΩ L2
- WLD ÔøΩ W (wild)
- EW (Explosivo Wild) ÔøΩ W with explosion animation
- SCR ÔøΩ S (scatter)

### 4. New Features Created 
- `src/features/wildSpawn.ts` - Wild spawning system after cluster wins
- `src/features/explosion.ts` - Explosivo Wild explosion mechanics
- `src/components/EWCollectionTracker.svelte` - UI for EW collection in free spins
- `src/game/bookEventHandlerMapExtended.ts` - Extended event handling
- `src/game/clusterDetection.ts` - Utilities for handling cluster data

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Storybook Import Error ‚úÖ FIXED
**Solution:** Pinned `@storybook/addon-svelte-csf` to version `5.0.0-next.27` to match cluster game.

### 2. Board Data Conversion ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue:** 7x7 board data from cluster game needed conversion to 5x5 for esqueleto.
**Solution:** Created `convert-boards.ts` to handle:
- Board dimension conversion (7x7 ‚Üí 5x5)
- Symbol mapping (H1‚ÜíLDY, H2‚ÜíPNK, etc.)
- Position coordinate conversion
- Proper padding (5 visible + 2 padding rows)

### 3. Scatter Symbol Display ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue:** Scatter symbols were disappearing when shown on grid.
**Solution:** Fixed symbol name checks in `stateGame.svelte.ts` (was checking for 'S', should be 'SCR').

### 4. Integration Tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Updated imports to use `bookEventHandlerMapEsqueleto`
- Added event type definitions for wild spawning and explosions
- Integrated EWCollectionTracker into Game.svelte
- Fixed Svelte 5 syntax in components

## Current Issues

### 1. Cluster Detection Display üö®
**Issue:** Cluster wins are detected but not displaying properly due to coordinate conversion between 7x7 and 5x5 grids.
**Status:** 
- Added position conversion logic in `bookEventHandlerMapEsqueleto.ts`
- Added validation and debug logging in Board.svelte
- Fixed scatter symbol asset mapping (S ‚Üí SCR)
- Fixed wild symbol asset mapping (W ‚Üí WLD/EW)
- Created test stories to debug win positions

**Fixes Applied:**
- Asset mappings corrected in assets.ts and constants.ts
- Symbol name checks updated (checking for 'SCR' instead of 'S')
- Position conversion logic implemented for both win animations and win amount display
- Added bounds checking to prevent array access errors

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Fix Cluster Detection Display
- Debug position conversion between 7x7 and 5x5 coordinates
- Ensure win overlay positions are correctly mapped
- Test with simple cluster wins to verify display

### 2. Testing & Validation
- Verify wild spawning after cluster wins
- Test EW explosion animations and low-pay symbol destruction
- Validate multiplier progression
- Test EW collection in free spins
- Ensure all reused components work with 5x5 grid

### 3. Theme Application (Lower Priority)
- Apply Day of the Dead color scheme
- Update backgrounds and decorations
- Add festive UI elements

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd apps/esqueleto
pnpm install

# Run development server (after fixes)
pnpm dev

# Run Storybook (after fixing imports)
pnpm storybook

# Lint check
pnpm lint
```

## Architecture Notes

### Reusability Stats
- ~90% code reused from existing games
- ~10% new code for Esqueleto-specific features
- Total new code: ~1000 lines

### Key Reused Components
- TumbleBoard (cascading mechanics)
- GlobalMultiplier (multiplier display)
- Board components (grid display)
- Symbol components (with asset remapping)
- Free spin framework
- Sound system
- State management

### Server-Side Logic
Cluster detection happens server-side. The client receives:
- `winInfo` events with cluster positions
- Win amounts and multipliers
- Board updates after tumbles

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Debug cluster detection display** - Check console logs when playing books with wins
2. **Test core gameplay** - Verify all game mechanics work correctly
3. **Apply theme styling** - Day of the Dead visuals (lower priority)

## Development Summary

The game is now **mostly playable** with the following status:
- ‚úÖ Core gameplay mechanics working
- ‚úÖ 5x5 grid properly configured
- ‚úÖ Symbol mapping and display correct
- ‚úÖ Storybook running without errors
- ‚úÖ Wild spawning and explosion features integrated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cluster detection needs position debugging
- üîÑ Theme styling pending

The main remaining issue is the cluster win display, which requires debugging the coordinate conversion between the 7x7 source data and 5x5 game grid.
